In Next.js, an uncommon error occurs when using the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions with dynamic routes and incorrect data fetching.  For example, if you attempt to fetch data based on a route parameter that doesn't exist or is formatted incorrectly, you might get an unexpected error or an empty response. This can be tricky to debug because the error might not be immediately obvious in the browser console.
