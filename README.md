# Next.js Data Fetching Error with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in Next.js applications when fetching data for dynamic routes.  The error occurs when the `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` functions receive invalid or unexpected route parameters, leading to incorrect data rendering or unexpected errors.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file shows an example of an application that attempts to fetch data based on a dynamic route parameter.  If the parameter is invalid or missing, the data fetching fails silently or throws an error not easily visible in the user interface, making debugging difficult. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution to handle potential errors during data fetching, ensuring more robust error handling and a better user experience.  This includes explicit error handling using `try...catch` blocks, comprehensive input validation of the route parameters, and returning an appropriate fallback state when data fetching fails.  This approach offers a more reliable and user-friendly experience.
